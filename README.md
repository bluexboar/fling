Fling is a puzzle game (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fling-lite/id325825863?mt=8)

This old code uses recursive algorithm to search a possible solution (brute force)

To improve:
- an iterative algorithm will be more efficient in this case
- narrow down search by using patterns (not every search in the brute force is meaningfull)
